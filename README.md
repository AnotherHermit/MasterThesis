# Voxel Cone Tracing on Mobile Devices

For my masters thesis I am implementing a voxel cone tracing system that should run on mobile hardware. 

## Who am I?

I am a student at Link√∂ping University currently on my 6th year of studies, out of which one was 
spent in South Korea. I have been studying applied physics and electronics with a specialization towards
signal and image processing. In the recent years I have become interested in computer graphics and this
is the reason why I am now doing my master thesis project in this field.

## The source

The source code is found in the VoxelConeTracing folder which is just a submodule for my other repo
VoxelConeTracing.

## Documentation

The main report documenting my results and the project is found in Documentation/ThesisReport and is 
a submodule for my other repo ThesisReport. There is also a preliminary planning report in 
"Documentation/Planning Report" and a updated time plan in "Documentation/Time Plan"
